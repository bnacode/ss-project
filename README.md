The goal of this project is to implement tools in the translation chain and an emulator for an abstract computer system as described in the specification.

The tools in the translation chain that have been implemented include an assembler for the specified abstract computer system, a linker independent of the target architecture, and an emulator on which the operation is emulated.

The original assembly code is written for the abstract computer system, which the assembler translates, the linker connects, and the emulator executes.
